# Val Ark — Decisions & Progress Log

Architecturally significant decisions and notable progress, newest first. Format:
**context → decision → why.** Append when you make a call worth remembering (or reversing
later). See [README](README.md).

## 2026‑07 — Reframe to a consumer appliance (scope‑first)
- **Context:** Val Ark was a power‑user/CLI tool; the goal is a router‑app / health‑app
  experience for a non‑technical owner ("one big EASY button").
- **Decision:** Scope the whole consumer experience *before* coding, as a cohesive 14‑doc
  hierarchy in [`docs/design/`](../design/README.md), grounded in a research sweep of 8
  comparable products ([research‑brief](../design/research-brief.md)). Implement per
  [roadmap](../design/roadmap.md); first sprint = **Commission + Recover**.
- **Why:** the surface area (commissioning, admin, access, recovery, storage, monitoring,
  moderation, deployment) is large and interdependent; getting the architecture right first
  avoids expensive rework.

### Key design calls (see the design docs for detail)
- **Access model:** operator chooses **Open (default) / Passworded / Accounts**; **two roles**
  (Admin + optional Viewer), never a usable default credential (only a one‑time claim token),
  **localhost/console always trusted as admin**. *Why:* a knowledge appliance's happy path is
  open‑on‑LAN; full RBAC is over‑engineering for the persona.
- **Recovery is paper‑backed + fully local:** a printed recovery card + two‑tier reset (button
  beeps / console menu / `valark setpassword`) + Safe Mode. *Why:* offline → no email reset;
  this is the single most important thing for "a box in a closet."
- **Content‑safety invariant:** the tiny `valark/state` (config) is physically separate from the
  multi‑TB content/model library; **no reset ever wipes Wikipedia/models** — only an explicit
  type‑the‑word disk‑erase does. *Why:* a panic reset must never re‑trigger a multi‑day download.
- **Storage is a growable pool:** primary (fixed, holds the brain) + add/remove drives (USB DAS),
  scaling to **SeaweedFS across computers**; track drives by UUID/label, graceful‑degrade on unplug.
- **Downloads:** disk‑sized **profiles** ("class roles") + **emphasis** (Knowledge/AI/Tools) drive
  curation weights + caps; "Fill everything (Recommended)" default.
- **On‑device moderation** (NPU) for shared uploads, default‑on, private, fail‑closed.
- **Deployment:** ship both a **Docker appliance image** *and* the bare‑metal bootstrap; both
  offline, both commissioned from the same wizard.

## 2026‑07 — First `dev → main` release (v1.1.0) + community sign‑ups (PR #2/#3)
- **Adopted the branch model in practice:** PR #1 (foundational) landed on `dev`; the
  community‑signups quick win (PR #2) landed on `dev`; then the first **`dev → main` release**
  (PR #3) shipped **v1.1.0**. Release cleared the high bar: CI green + full local Playwright
  (310/1) + services e2e (11/0) + **fresh‑VM matrix 27/0 across Ubuntu 22.04/24.04/26.04**.
- **CI is a real gate now.** A fresh CI checkout has *no mirror*, so host‑population tests
  (on‑disk binaries, non‑empty status maps) **skip‑when‑empty**; CI validates code + endpoint
  shape + upstream URL health, while populated‑system e2e runs locally + in the VM matrix. One
  real strict‑mode locator bug was fixed (`#install-btn-<id>` vs `:has-text("Mirror")`).
- **Community account model = per‑service tech, not one UX** ([[val-ark-forum-proxy-burst-quirk]]):
  `COMMUNITY_ACCOUNTS[id].signup` ∈ `host｜self｜shared`. chat/mail = host‑provisioned
  (`<svc>.sh adduser`, one‑step for mail); forum = NodeBB self‑register; paste = shared gated
  instance. `POST /api/service/adduser` is **localhost‑only** (minting a login is admin).
- **Release merge = rebase (main requires linear history).** Rebase‑merge re‑parents dev's
  commits onto `main`, so after a release `main` and `dev` share *content* but diverge by *SHA*
  (`git diff origin/main origin/dev` is empty; commit counts differ). This is benign: GitHub's
  rebase‑merge skips already‑applied patches, so the next release applies only new commits. Tag
  `main`'s tip directly (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`) — `scripts/release.sh` wants a clean tree, which the
  untracked local `.memsearch/` trips.

## 2026‑07 — Feature branch: discover/request + self‑replication + tests (PR #1)
- Shipped + deployed to the ARM64 NAS test node + tested (337 tests): Library relabel; Community hub; one‑click
  LAN/tailnet **catalog + request** with **pin + cap‑aware auto‑evict**; **offline
  self‑replication** (git bundle + Node runtime + `bootstrap.sh` + `mirror-self.sh`); fixed
  per‑platform app downloads (`/api/archive`); cross‑arch service fixes; curation (Linux docs +
  setup assistants); the **test library + offline HTML report + fresh‑VM matrix (Ubuntu 22/24/26)**.
- **Why the request/evict shape:** the librarian already did diversity→small‑value→fill→evict;
  a per‑item `request` that pins + evicts the lowest‑priority *unpinned* content extends it
  cleanly and honors the footprint cap.

## Earlier project facts (fleet, curation)
- **Fleet/hardware & mesh:** big shared disk, several boxes (an ARM64 Grace‑Blackwell node, an x86 GPU workstation, a router, an ARM64 NAS),
  NFS/Syncthing sharing, tailscale‑ssh. The data disk is the one shared mirror; GPU nodes infer
  over the network. (Host‑specific addresses/creds are **not** in git — see the deployment host's
  own `.env`.)
- **Curation priority model:** live Kiwix OPDS catalog → planner phases
  diversity → small‑value → fill → evict‑for‑better; value = curated category weight + language +
  density + topic boosts (now including a strong Linux/shell boost, so an offline user can get
  setup help from the box).
